iPhone Inventory System
The iPhone Inventory System is a web application that helps keep track of inventory levels for different iPhone models. It has two main pages: User Page and Admin Login Page.

User Page
The User Page displays a table of iPhone models with their descriptions, colors, quantities, and prices. Users can view the available models and add them to their cart by clicking the Add to Cart button.

Admin Login Page
The Admin Login Page is where the admin logs in to access the admin dashboard. The admin enters their username and password to access the dashboard.

Admin Dashboard
The Admin Dashboard displays a list of all iPhone models, their descriptions, colors, quantities, and prices. The admin can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on the iPhone models.

Create Operation
The admin can add new iPhone models by filling out a form that asks for the model name, description, color, quantity, and price. The system will then add the new model to the database and update the inventory levels accordingly.

Read Operation
The admin can view a list of all iPhone models in the database. The system displays the model name, description, color, quantity, and price for each model.

Update Operation
The admin can update the quantity and price of existing iPhone models. The system updates the database and inventory levels accordingly.

Delete Operation
The admin can delete existing iPhone models from the database. The system removes the model from the database and updates the inventory levels accordingly.

Inventory Tracking
The system tracks inventory levels for each iPhone model. When a user adds an iPhone model to their cart, the system checks if the quantity of the model is sufficient. If the quantity is not sufficient, the system displays a warning message to the user.

Business Logic
The business logic of the iPhone Inventory System is written in PHP. The system uses PHP to connect to the MySQL database and perform CRUD operations on the iPhone models. The system also uses PHP to check the inventory levels and display warning messages to users if necessary.

Overall, the iPhone Inventory System provides an easy and efficient way to manage inventory levels for different iPhone models. The system is user-friendly and provides real-time inventory tracking to ensure that the inventory levels are always up-to-date.
